 # Introduction to Programming Swift - Playgrounds
 A Swift Playground is a way to experiment with Swift and parts of Apple's API. We will be using it to try out some of the Swift language, which will support you in the different topics that we cover in the rest of this course.
 
 There is much more to Swift and you can find the details in [The Swift Programming Language (Swift 3.0.1)](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH3-ID0). For the purposes of this course, we are focusing on the following:
 
 * [Declarations](Declarations) - Covers how to define variables and constants
 * [Functions](Functions) - Covers how to define and call functions
 * [Classes](Classes) - Covers the basic definition of classes
 * [Optionals](Optionals) - Introduces the topic of optionals, which handle the situation where there isn't a value specified for a variable or constant.

 
 ## Your First Playground Code
 When you create a Playground in Xcode, you will see the code shown below. On the right, in the grey area, you can see the value of what str is. Move the mouse cursor over the word str. Press Option-Click (⌥ + Click, where Click is pressing the Mouse Button) - you will see a popup that shows its type.
 
 - note: 
 The Option key (⌥) is to the left and right of the Cmd key, either side of the Space key.
 
 */
import UIKit

var str = "Hello, playground"

 When you ⌥ + Click, you should have seen the type describe as 'var str: String' - we will explain this further in the next page.
 
 We will explore some of the features of Swift in different pages. You can quickly access the pages from the contents above, or by using the Next and Previous links on each page.
