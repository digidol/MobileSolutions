# Playgrounds
This section contains some Playgrounds used to explore some of the language features in Swift. 

For 2016-2017, we will use the Introduction to Programming Swift playground.  

Other playgrounds are for older versions of Swift and need to be updated.

* ArraysAndDictionaries - Looks at the basic way to create and manipulate the arrays and dictionaries using Swift. 
* Functions - Looks at the key topics for defining functions. 
* Optionals - Looks at the motivation for Optionals and the ways that they can be used.
